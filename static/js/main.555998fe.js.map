By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n\t * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n\t * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n\t * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n\t *\n\t * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n\t * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n\t * visit function.\n\t *\n\t *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n\t *       enter(node, key, parent, path,

visit(ast, {\n\t *       enter(node) {\n\t *         // enter any node\n\t *       },\n\t *       leave(node) {\n\t *         // leave any node\n\t *       }\n\t *     })\n\t *\n\t * 4) Parallel
